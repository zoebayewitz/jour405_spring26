title: "UMD Fees"

Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate percentage change using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.


### Task 1: Load the tidyverse


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```




### Task 2: Load the UMD Fees dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv

```{r}
umd_fees <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/umd_fees.csv")
```

### Task 3: Calculate the percentage change in each category between Fall 2024 and Fall 2021 using `mutate()`

```{r}
umd_fees_pct <- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2024`- `Fall 2021`)/`Fall 2021` * 100)
```

```{r}
umd_fees_pct_2524<- umd_fees |> mutate(pct_change = (`Fall 2025`- `Fall 2024`)/`Fall 2024` * 100)
```

```{r}
comp <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/class_composition.csv")

comp |>
  summarize(
    mean_first = mean(first_year),
    mean_soph = mean(sophomore),
    mean_junior = mean(junior),
    mean_senior = mean(senior),
    mean_grad = mean(grad)
  )
```


### Task 4: Describe our results

Write a few sentences about what you found in the data. What's the story here?

Based on the positive percent changes, UMD student fees have gone up in nearly every category, except athletics. This can be a story about increased student fees and what these costs are being used for. This can also be a bigger story about the increasing costs of higher education and, with more data, how the economy affects these prices. 



When you are done, save your work, switch to GitHub Desktop, then add, commit and push your changes to GitHub and submit the URL of the notebook in ELMS.

title: "Car Thefts"
---

Follow along with the demo to learn how to calculate standard deviation and how to create a histogram of the data using R and the Tidyverse. Get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


### Task 2: Load the car thefts dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/car_thefts_jan24.csv


```{r}
car_thefts <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/car_thefts_jan24.csv")
```

### Task 3: Calculate the standard deviation of the number of car thefts, along with the mean

```{r}
car_thefts |> summarize(mean = mean(count), sd = sd(count))
```


### Task 4: Create a histogram of the number of car thefts

```{r}
car_thefts |> 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x = count), binwidth = 2) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(count)), color = "red", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(count) - sd(count)), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(count) + sd(count)), color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size = 1)
```




### Task 5: Add a line to the histogram that shows the mean of the number of car thefts, and two other lines to show one standard deviation in both directions


### Task 6: Describe your results

Is the distribution normal or skewed in one direction? Write a sentence in which you describe the range of the data covered by one standard deviation from the mean on both sides - how much of the data falls in that range?
